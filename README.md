# awesome-dummy-sample-files

I need these files to test download features in different side projects.
Perhaps you need them too.
Send a PR if you want to add new sample file.

## Steps to contribute:

- Fork the repository
- Add file/s in your local branch
- push to origin and make a pull request to main

## Advice:

- Make sure the file is small i.e. <10KB in size.
- File should be named "sample.file_extension" where file_extension is any valid file extension.
- Must not contain any copyright material
